  "description": "Flap your way to victory by popping enemy balloons in this gravity-based aerial combat simulator.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on buoyancy and momentum physics, providing a unique challenge for AI agents to master precise thrust control and collision detection in a 2D space. It targets fans of classic arcade action and developers interested in physics-based movement.",
  "details": "The game is a simplified 2D side-scroller. The player controls a character with two balloons attached. Gravity constantly pulls the character down. Pressing the flap key provides upward momentum. Enemies fly around with their own balloons. Colliding with an enemy from above pops their balloon, causing them to fall. If an enemy touches the player from above or the side without the player being higher, the player loses a life. The level contains floating platforms that block movement.",
  "physics_engine": "Simplified Euler integration for velocity and position updates. Elastic collisions for wall bounces.",
  "input_space": "Discrete: 0 (No action), 1 (Flap/Thrust).",
  "observation_space": "Continuous: [player_x, player_y, player_vx, player_vy, enemy_n_x, enemy_n_y, enemy_n_active].",
  "reward_structure": "Score +100 for popping an enemy, +500 for clearing a wave, -10 per frame spent falling below screen bounds, -1000 for losing a life.",
  "how_to_build": "uv sync",
  "how_to_start": "uv run main.py",
  "how_to_stop": "killall python",
  "how_to_play": "Use the UP ARROW or SPACE key to flap and gain altitude. The goal is to land on top of enemies to pop their balloons. Avoid letting enemies touch you from above. Score increases with every enemy defeated and every wave completed.",
  "how_to_cleanup": "rm -rf .venv && rm -rf __pycache__",
