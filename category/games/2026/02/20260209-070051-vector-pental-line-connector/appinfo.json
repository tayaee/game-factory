  "description": "A strategic logic puzzle where you connect five stones to dominate the board.",
  "rationale": "This game targets fans of classic abstract strategy like Gomoku or Connect Four. It provides a perfect environment for AI agents to learn spatial reasoning, pattern recognition, and minimax-based decision-making with a clear win/loss reward system.",
  "details": "The game is a simplified version of Gomoku played on a 15x15 grid. Players take turns placing a black or white stone on an empty intersection. The objective is to be the first to form an unbroken line of exactly five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game engine handles turn-based logic, illegal move prevention (e.g., placing on an occupied spot), and win-state detection. For AI training, the board state is exported as a 2D array where 0 is empty, 1 is Player 1, and 2 is Player 2.",

  "how_to_play": "Players use the mouse left-click to place a stone on grid intersections. To increase the score, the agent must complete a line of 5 stones. Points are awarded +100 for a win, -100 for a loss, and +1 for each sequence of 3 or 4 stones created during the process. The game ends when one player connects five or the board is full (draw).",
