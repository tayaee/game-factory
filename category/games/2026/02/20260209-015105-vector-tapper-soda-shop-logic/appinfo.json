  "description": "Serve thirsty customers before they reach the end of the bar in this fast-paced retro management sim.",
  "rationale": "This game tests multitasking skills, reflexes, and resource management. It is designed for players who enjoy high-pressure arcade classics and for AI agents to learn optimal pathfinding and task prioritization.",
  "details": "The game consists of four horizontal bars. Customers appear at the left end of each bar and slowly advance toward the right. The player controls a bartender who must pour drinks and send them sliding down the bar to the customers. When a customer receives a drink, they are pushed back or exit the screen. If a customer reaches the right end of the bar, or if the player throws a drink where there is no customer, a life is lost. Empty mugs are occasionally sent back by customers, which the player must catch to avoid breakage. The game speed and customer frequency increase over time.",
