  "description": "A fast-paced 1v1 ice hockey duel focusing on physics-based puck control and strategic positioning.",
  "rationale": "This game targets casual players and AI researchers. It provides a clean environment for testing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where agents must coordinate movement and shot timing in a low-friction physics environment.",
  "details": "The game consists of a rectangular rink with two goals on opposite ends. Two circular players (Home and Away) move in a 2D space. A puck starts at the center. Players use physics-based momentum to bump the puck into the opponent's goal. Rules: 1. Friction is extremely low to simulate ice. 2. Players cannot cross the center line (simplified version). 3. First to 5 points wins. 4. Puck bounces off walls with elastic collisions.",

  "how_to_stop": "Press 'ESC' or close the window.",
  "how_to_play": "Goal: Hit the puck into the enemy goal (right side for Player 1). Scoring: Each goal grants 1 point. Controls: Player 1 uses Arrow Keys for movement and 'Space' for a short-range burst (slapshot). Player 2 (or AI) uses WASD and 'Shift'. Scoring a goal resets the puck to the center.",
