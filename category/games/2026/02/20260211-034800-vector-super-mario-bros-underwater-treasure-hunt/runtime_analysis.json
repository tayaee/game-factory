  "conclusion": "The Vector Super Mario Bros Underwater Treasure Hunt game successfully starts and runs without any issues. All core mechanics function correctly including player movement with buoyancy physics, enemy spawning and AI, coin collection, collision detection, scoring system, and game state management. The game maintains stable 60 FPS performance and properly manages memory by cleaning up off-screen entities. No crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior occurred during the 2-minute runtime test."
