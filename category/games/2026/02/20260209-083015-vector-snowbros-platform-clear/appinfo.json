  "description": "Turn enemies into snowballs and roll them to clear the floor in this classic arcade platformer.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on complex state transitions and chain-reaction physics. It targets developers interested in collision logic, enemy AI states, and those who enjoy the classic bubble-bobble style gameplay with a freezing twist.",
  "details": "The game consists of a single-screen platform layout. The player controls a character that shoots snow breath. Enemies hit by snow breath gradually freeze. Once fully frozen, the enemy becomes a snowball. The player can then push the snowball, which rolls along platforms, falls down ledges, and bounces off walls, destroying any non-frozen enemies in its path. A level is cleared when all enemies are defeated. The game includes gravity physics, platform jumping, and distinct enemy behaviors like patrolling and chasing.",
