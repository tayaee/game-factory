  "description": "Navigate a treacherous castle filled with firebars and lava pits in this precision platformer.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on the high-difficulty 'Castle' levels of classic platformers. It targets players who enjoy tight hitboxes, rhythmic obstacle patterns, and physics-based jumping challenges. It serves as an excellent environment for RL agents to learn timing and spatial awareness.",
  "details": "The game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer set in a castle environment. The player controls a character that must reach the axe at the end of the level. Key elements include: 1. Firebars: Rotating lines of fire balls that rotate at fixed speeds. 2. Lava Pits: Instant death zones if the character falls in. 3. Moving Platforms: Horizontal and vertical oscillating platforms. 4. Boss (Bowser-lite): A static enemy at the end that jumps and throws projectiles at fixed intervals. The game uses a 16x16 grid-based collision system with gravity and acceleration physics.",
