      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "All required files are present: appinfo.json, pyproject.toml, main.py, game.py, config.py, and README.md."
    },
    "build_configuration": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "pyproject.toml is properly configured with correct project metadata, Python version requirements (>=3.12,<3.14), and build system (hatchling). The dependency on pygame>=2.5.0 is correctly specified."

    "entry_point": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "main.py exists with proper if __name__ == '__main__' guard. The entry point imports and runs Game class from game.py."

    "main_module": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "game.py contains a complete ReversiGame class with all necessary methods: __init__, reset_game, make_move, handle_event, draw, and run. A Game alias is provided for consistency."
    },
    "configuration_module": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "config.py properly defines all game constants including screen dimensions, colors, game states, directions, font sizes, and animation settings."

      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "Imports are correct: pygame for graphics, sys for exit, and config for constants (using wildcard import from config)."
    },
    "game_logic": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "Reversi/Othello game logic appears correctly implemented: 8x8 grid initialization with starting position, valid move calculation using 8 directions, piece flipping mechanics, turn switching with no-move handling, and game-over detection."
    },
    "pygame_integration": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "Pygame is properly initialized with pygame.init(), display setup, event handling (QUIT, KEYDOWN, MOUSEMOTION, MOUSEBUTTONDOWN), and 60 FPS frame rate limiting."
    },
    "build_command_check": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "Build command 'uv sync' is compatible with the project setup. The .venv directory exists and contains installed packages."
    },
    "start_command_check": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "Start command 'uv run main.py' is valid. main.py contains the main() function and proper entry point."

  "potential_issues": [],
  "recommendations": [
    "The wildcard import 'from config import *' is used in game.py. While functional, explicit imports are generally preferred for better code clarity.",
    "The config.py imports os module but doesn't use it - this can be cleaned up.",
    "Consider adding type hints for better code documentation and IDE support."
