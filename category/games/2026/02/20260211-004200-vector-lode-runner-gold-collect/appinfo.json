  "description": "Navigate platforms and dig traps to collect all gold pieces while avoiding guards.",
  "rationale": "This game is a simplified version of the classic Lode Runner. It serves as an excellent environment for AI agents to practice pathfinding, strategic environmental manipulation (digging), and adversarial evasion in a grid-based platformer.",
  "details": "The game consists of a 2D grid with platforms, ladders, and gold pieces. The player must collect all gold pieces on the level to reveal the exit ladder and progress. Key mechanics: 1. Gravity: Characters fall if there is no floor or ladder beneath them. 2. Digging: The player can dig holes in the floor to the left or right. Holes stay open for 5 seconds before regenerating. 3. Guards: Simple AI guards chase the player. If a guard falls into a hole, they are trapped for 4 seconds, allowing the player to walk over them. 4. Collision: Touching a guard results in immediate game over.",
