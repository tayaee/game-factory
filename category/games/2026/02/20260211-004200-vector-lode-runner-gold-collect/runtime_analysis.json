    "The game is a single-file Python implementation of Lode Runner.",
    "All game assets are drawn programmatically - no external image files required.",
    "The game loop handles quit events gracefully (ESC key or window close).",
    "Guard AI uses simple chase logic based on player position.",
    "Level design includes multiple platforms, ladders, ropes for vertical traversal.",
    "The game implements the classic Lode Runner mechanic of digging holes to trap enemies."
  ],
  "conclusion": "The Vector Lode Runner Gold Collect game successfully starts and runs all basic functionality as designed. The game loop, physics, collision detection, AI, and rendering systems all function correctly. No errors or crashes were observed during the 2-minute runtime analysis."
