All core game mechanics are implemented including player movement with smooth interpolation, block pushing with sliding animations, enemy AI with tracking and random behaviors, collision detection for all entity types, scoring system with bonuses, particle effects, and complete game state management. The code is well-structured with proper object-oriented design, type hints, and follows the specifications from appinfo.json."
