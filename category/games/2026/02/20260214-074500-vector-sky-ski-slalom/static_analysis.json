  "project_name": "vector-sky-ski-slalom",
  "overall_status": "PASSED",
  "summary": "The project is well-structured with proper Python project setup. All required files are present, dependencies are correctly specified, and the code follows good practices. The application should build and start successfully.",
  "checks": {
    "project_structure": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "All required files are present: main.py (entry point), game.py, entities.py, renderer.py, config.py, pyproject.toml, and appinfo.json."
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "pyproject.toml correctly specifies 'pygame>=2.6.0' as the only dependency. Python version requirement '>=3.12' is appropriate. The .venv directory with pygame 2.6.1 is already present, indicating dependencies have been installed."
    },
    "entry_point": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "main.py exists and contains a proper main() function with if __name__ == '__main__' guard. The file correctly imports and initializes pygame, creates Game and Renderer instances, and runs the main game loop."
    },
    "imports": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "All imports are valid and follow proper module structure: pygame, sys (standard library), and local modules (game, renderer, entities, config). No circular import dependencies detected."
    },
    "syntax_analysis": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "All Python files have valid syntax. Code follows Python conventions with proper indentation, naming, and structure."
    },
    "build_configuration": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "how_to_build command 'uv run python -m pip install pygame' is correct. The project uses uv package manager as evidenced by pyproject.toml and uv.lock files."
    },
    "startup_configuration": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "how_to_start command 'uv run main.py' matches the project structure. main.py is executable and contains proper initialization code."
    },
    "game_logic": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "Game class properly implements update loop with delta time (dt). All entities (Player, Obstacle, Gate) are properly implemented with update methods. Collision detection uses pygame.Rect.colliderect which is reliable."
    },
    "renderer": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "Renderer class properly initializes pygame display with correct resolution (400x600 as specified). All drawing methods use valid pygame drawing functions. Game over screen and HUD are properly implemented."
    },
    "configuration": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "config.py contains all necessary constants with appropriate values. Screen dimensions, colors, player settings, game mechanics, and scoring constants are well-defined."
    },
    "event_handling": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "details": "Proper event handling for pygame.QUIT, pygame.KEYDOWN with ESC for quit, and 'R' key for restart when game is over. Input polling for continuous key states (left/right arrows)."
    },
    "potential_issues": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "warnings": [
        "The game requires a display (uses pygame.display.set_mode). This will not work in headless environments.",
        "Frame rate is capped at 60 FPS using clock.tick(60), which is appropriate for this type of game.",
        "No exception handling for pygame initialization failures - could be an issue on systems without display support."
      ],
      "details": "Minor warnings noted but none are critical for typical desktop environments."
