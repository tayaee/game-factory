  "description": "Slice falling fruits with precision swipes while avoiding dangerous bombs in this vector-style reflex challenge.",
  "rationale": "This game targets users looking for fast-paced, satisfying arcade action. It provides a perfect environment for AI agents to practice high-speed spatial trajectory prediction and gesture recognition.",
  "details": "The game is a simplified 2D physics-based slicing game. Various circular 'fruits' are tossed into the screen from the bottom at different angles and velocities. The player must move a cursor or swipe to intersect these objects. If a fruit is sliced, it splits into two halves and adds points. Occasionally, 'bombs' are tossed; hitting a bomb results in an immediate game over or point deduction. The game speeds up as time progresses, increasing the frequency of spawns.",

  "how_to_play": "Move the mouse cursor rapidly across the falling circles (fruits) to slice them. Each slice increases your score. Do not touch the red spiked circles (bombs). If a fruit falls off the bottom of the screen without being sliced, you lose health or points. High scores are recorded based on the number of successful consecutive slices.",
