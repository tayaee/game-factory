  "description": "Cross the treacherous river by hopping on moving logs in this classic timing challenge.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on the core river-crossing mechanic of the classic arcade genre, emphasizing velocity matching and precise spatial timing. It provides a clean environment for AI agents to learn movement relative to moving platforms.",
  "details": "The game features a grid-based movement system where a frog must navigate from the bottom bank to the top goal. The middle area is a river with multiple lanes. Each lane has logs moving at different speeds and directions. If the frog is on a log, it inherits the log's horizontal velocity. The game ends if the frog touches the water (falling off a log or missing a jump) or hits the screen boundaries while drifting on a log. Obstacles include varying log lengths and speeds. The goal is to reach the safety of the top bank to score points.",
