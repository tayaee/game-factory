  "conclusion": "The Vector Galaxian Swarm Attack game successfully launches and all core functionality works as designed. The game implements all the features described in appinfo.json including player movement, shooting, enemy formation with diving AI using Bezier curves, collision detection, scoring system, and wave progression. The application is stable, runs at target 60 FPS, and cleanly shuts down. No runtime errors or critical bugs were detected during the 60-second test period."
